# Neural Networks in Python: Attempt 1
#### [Exr0n/python_net_1](https://github.com/Exr0n/python_net_1)

This project is here so I can screw around with neural nets and backprop. The basis of this project is [A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python by iamtrask](https://iamtrask.github.io/2015/07/12/basic-python-network/). Check out the article and related content, its pretty great for a quick neural net intro!
